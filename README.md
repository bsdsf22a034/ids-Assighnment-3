Creating a Jupyter Notebook
Overview
This README provides instructions for creating and using a Jupyter Notebook file. Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to combine code execution, text, and visualizations in a single environment.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook
You can install Jupyter using pip:

.bash
.Copy code
.pip install notebook
.Creating a Jupyter Notebook
.Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Launch your terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

Start Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to your project directory and run:

.bash
.Copy code
.jupyter notebook
.This command will open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your default web browser.

Create a New Notebook

In the Jupyter dashboard, click on the New button on the right.
Select Python 3 (or your preferred kernel) from the dropdown menu.
Name Your Notebook

Click on the default name (e.g., Untitled) at the top of the page.
Enter a new name for your notebook and hit Enter.
Adding Content

You can add code cells, markdown cells, and more:
Code Cells: Write your Python code and press Shift + Enter to execute.
Markdown Cells: Use these for documentation. You can format text using Markdown syntax.
Saving Your Notebook

Save your work by clicking the disk icon or pressing Ctrl + S.
Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of adding code and text in a Jupyter Notebook:

python
Copy code
# Example code to display "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
Adding Markdown
You can add a markdown cell with the following text:

markdown
Copy code
# My First Jupyter Notebook

.This notebook demonstrates how to create a Jupyter Notebook and execute code.
.Running Your Notebook
.To run a cell, click on it and press Shift + Enter.
.You can also run all cells by clicking on Cell in the menu and selecting Run All.
Conclusion
.You have now created your first Jupyter Notebook! Explore additional features such as exporting to different formats, adding visualizations, and using extensions to enhance your workflow.

.For further details, refer to the Jupyter documentation.
